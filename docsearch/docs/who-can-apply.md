title: Who can apply?

We built DocSearch from the ground up with the idea of improving search on large
technical documentation. For that reason, we are offering a free hosting version
to all online technical documentation.

We're always sad to have to turn down applications, but with the number of
requests we receive everyday, we've had to focus on fair criteria. We hope you
understand.

## The checklist

To have your request validated, we'll ask that you check all the following
points.

- You must be the **owner** of the website, or at least have the power to update
  its content. You'll have to include a JavaScript snippet to enable DocSearch.

- Your website must be **publicly available**. We do not host index for websites
  that are available behind an authentication or a private network.

- Your website must be a **documentation website**. We do not index blogs or
  commercial content.

- Your website must **have some final content**. We won't index empty websites
  nor those filled with lorem ipsum placeholder content. Please, wait until you
  have written some documentation before applying. We would be happy to help you
  as soon as you have a steady design.

If in doubt, don't hesitate to [apply][1] and we'll figure it out together.

Even if we cannot accept your request, this does not mean that you cannot enjoy
great search on your website. DocSearch is entirely open source and [you can run
it yourself][2], or use any of [our other API clients][3] to take advantage of
Algolia's features.

## Priority

We're receiving dozens of requests every day, and while we strive to answer them
all as fast as we can, we sometimes give priority to some based on the following
criteria:

- üòÄ If your project is open source, we'll handle it before any other
  closed-source product. We love open source and want to help as much as we can.

- üôÇ If you're using one of our [official integrations][4], creating your config
  will be much faster for us.

- üôÅ If we need to render your website in the browser through JavaScript, it
  means that we'll have to crawl it through a much slower browser emulation. We
  highly recommend that you put in place server-side rendering for the useful
  textual content.
