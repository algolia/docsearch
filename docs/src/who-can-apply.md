DocSearch was built from the ground up with the idea of improving search on
large technical documentation. For that reason, we offering our free hosting
version to all technical documentations.

We're always sad to have to turn down applications, but with the number of
requests we received everyday, we had to focus on several criteria. We
hope you understand.

### The checklist

To have your request validated, we'll ask that you valide all the following
points.

- You must be the **owner** of the website, or at least have the power to update
  its content. You'll have to include a JavaScript snippet to enable DocSearch.

- Your website must be **publicly available**. We do not host index for websites
  that are available behind an authentication or a private network.

- Your website must be a **documentation website**. We do not index blogs and
  commercial content.

- Your website must **have some final content**. We won't index empty websites nor
  those filled with lorem ipsum placeholder content. Please, wait until you have
  written some documentation before applying. We would be happy to help you as soon as you have a steady design.

If in doubt, don't hesitate to [apply][1] and we'll figure it out together.

Even if we cannot accept your request, this does not mean that you cannot enjoy
great search on your website. DocSearch is entirely open source and [you can run
it yourself][2], or use any of [our other API clients][3] to take advantage of the
Algolia's features.

### Priority

We're receiving dozens of requests every day, and while we strive to answer them
all as fast as we can, we sometimes give priority to some of them based on the
following criteria:

- 🙂 If your project is open source, We'll handle it before any other
  close-source product. We love open source and want to help as much as we can.

- 🙂 If you're using one of our [official integrations][4], creating your config
  will be much faster for us.

- ☹️ If your website is rendered in the browser through JavaScript, it means
  that we'll have to crawl it through a much slower browser emulation. We highly
  recommend that you put in place server-side rendering for the useful textual content.
