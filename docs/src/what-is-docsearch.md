We're scratching our own itch here. As developers, we spend a lot of time
reading documentation, and it isn't always easy to find the information we need.

Not blaming anyone here. Building a good search for a documentation is a complex
challenge. We happen to have a lot of experience doing that, and we want to
share it with the world.


DocSearch will provide, for free and out of the box, the Algolia search
experience for your documentation website. You only need to [ask us to configure
your site](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/) or
[submit you own configuration](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch-configs). We'll
get back to you with what you need to integrate your new search into your website.

 1. We'll **configure** your search experience,
 2. We'll **crawl** and **scrap** your documentation pages every 24h accordingly,
 3. You'll only need to **add few lines to your website**: a Javascript snippet along with 2 libraries (JS & CSS).

 **NB:** If you prefer to DIY, you can [run the scraper](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch-scraper)
 in your own infra. Feel free to fork!
