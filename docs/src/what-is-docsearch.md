title: What is DocSearch?
---

### Why?

DocSearch is born out of the need to scratch our own itch. As developers, we
spent a lot of time reading documentation, and it can be hard to find relevant
information in large documentations. We're not blaming anyone here; building a
good search is a challenge.

It happens that we are a search company and we actually have a lot of experience
building search interfaces. We wanted to use those skills to help others. That's
why we created a way to automatically extract content from tech documentation
and make it available to everyone from the first keystroke.

### Quick description

DocSearch itself is made of a crawler and a frontend library. We run the crawler
on our end every 24h to extract content from your website and push it to an
Algolia index. You'll then have to add the frontend library to your website to
redirect all the search requests to this index.

### How to feature DocSearch?

DocSearch is entirely free and automated. The one thing we'll need from you is
to read [our checklist][2] and apply! After that, we'll share with you the
JavaScript snippet needed to add DocSearch to your website. We ask that you keep
the "powered by Algolia" link displayed.

DocSearch is [one of our ways][1] to give back to the open source community for
everything it did for us already.
