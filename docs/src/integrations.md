We worked with documentation website generators to have DocSearch directly
embedded as a first class citizen in website they produce. If you're using one
of the following tools, checkout their documentation to see how to enable
DocSearch on your website:

- [Docusaurus][1] - [How to enable search][2]
- [VuePress][3] - [Algolia Search][4]
- [GitBook][5]
- [pkgdown][6] - [DocSearch indexing][7]

If you're a maintaining a similar tool and would like to be added to the list, get
[in touch with us][8], we would be happy to help.
