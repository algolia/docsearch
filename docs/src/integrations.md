We worked with **documentation website generators** to have DocSearch directly
embedded as a first class citizen in the websites they produce.

## Our great integrations:

So, if you're using one of the following tools, checkout their documentation to
see how to enable DocSearch on your website:

- [Docusaurus][1] - [How to enable search][2]
- [VuePress][3] - [Algolia Search][4]
- [GitBook][5]
- [pkgdown][6] - [DocSearch indexing][7]
- [LaRecipe][8] - [Algolia Search][9]

Additionally, if you're a maintaining a similar tool and would like to be added
to the list, get [in touch with us][10]. We'd be happy to help.
