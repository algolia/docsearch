## Introduction

We're scratching our own itch here. As developers, we spend a lot of time
reading documentation, and it isn't always easy to find the information we need.

Not blaming anyone here. Building a good search for a documentation is a complex
challenge. We happen to have a lot of experience doing that, and we want to
share it with the world. For free.

Just submit the form on the [website](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/) and we'll get back to you with what
you need to integrate your new search into your website.

 1. We'll crawl your documentation pages,
 2. We'll configure your search experience,
 3. You'll need to add a bit of JavaScript and CSS code to your website.

If you prefer to DIY, you can run the [scraper](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch-scraper) in your own infra.

## Including the docsearch files in the frontend

Once we've crawled your documentation website we'll send you the credentials you
need to add the following code snippet to your website:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsearch.js@2/dist/cdn/docsearch.min.css" />
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsearch.js@2/dist/cdn/docsearch.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
docsearch({
  apiKey: '<API_KEY>',
  indexName: '<INDEX_NAME>',
  inputSelector: '<YOUR_INPUT_DOM_SELECTOR>'
});
</script>
```

You can also install docsearch via `npm`:

```sh
npm install --save docsearch.js
```
