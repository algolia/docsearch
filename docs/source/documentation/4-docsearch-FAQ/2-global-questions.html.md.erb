## What is the general behaviour?

### How often do you scrap my website?

We scrap your website, at least, every 24 hours since documentation is not meant to change frequently.
Furthermore we update it after every pull request on your configuration. This is the best way to request us to trigger a new crawl. Please leverage your configuration file to do so.

###  I want to add search to my whole website?
DocSearch is suited for documentation content. If you want to widen the scope of your search to not documentation content. You have two solutions:
- [Run it on your own](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/documentation/docsearch-scraper/overview/)
- Build your own search-UI [thanks to InstanteSearch](https://community.algolia.com/instantsearch.js/) ([example here](https://jsfiddle.net/s_pace/965a4w3o/))

### Does the crawl encompass several domains/sub-domains?

The `start_urls` define the allowed domain for our crawler. Basically, we take the main domain of every URLs. We will not go outside this whitelisted domain list. If you want to encompass a wider domain, please include it as a new start_url.

### Where is hosted the data?

As every Algolia index, everything is stored on our servers with the security and privacy required. You can [find more details in the global documentation pages.](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/infrastructure/servers/)

## Feature

### Will it become paid?

Open source is great and we want to support as much as we can. Since these projects mostly have limited resources, every granted project will ever remain free.
If you want to upgrade your search experience, you can do it with your own Algolia implementation and [apply for a free community plan](https://www.algolia.com/pricing). DocSearch will not be used anymore but still happy to help.

### What data are you collecting, who can get access to it?

We only scrap publicly available data according to your custom selectors (see the how it works part). DocSearch introduces [the algolia analytics](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/insights-and-analytics/analytics-overview/) for your DocSearch indices.
You can ask access to these data by using the private email thread and send us the email addresses of the people to grant access.

### Where can I see the analytics?

Once you are granted (see above), analytics will be available in the Algolia dashboard like any regular application. You will need to select the analytics tabs.

## I am not the owner, what can i do?

You can definitely help improving the search experience of your favourite documentation website by opening issues on the repo. You can also reference the GitHub handle @s-pace if you want us to chime in / provide you a quick demo. You can advocate the owner of the repo by letting them request DocSearch. We would be happy to support you in such regards. Feel free to ping.
