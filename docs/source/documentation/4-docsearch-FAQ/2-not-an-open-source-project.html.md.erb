title: Your project is not open source?

## Our policy

We really want to improve documentation with search. Finding the information you are looking for is the very first step when reading docs. Search is key.

If your project is not open source but you still have a documentation website, it deserves a good search. You can [run DocSearch on your own infra](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/documentation/docsearch-scraper/overview/) and [create your own Algolia account](https://www.algolia.com/users/sign_up). We would be happy to [enhance DocSearch with your feedback](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch).

## How could you qualify?

By focusing on open source projects, we want to make our contribution to the open source community. We are learning every day thanks to this incredible way of learning. we want to help. We do ask a link to the project repo, e.g. gitlab, github or any other terms of use that outlines this peculiarity.

## My project is already featured or uses a *supported* documentation-generator tool (e.g. [pkgdown](http://pkgdown.r-lib.org/index.html), [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), [gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/), [vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) ...) ?

DocSearch is totally handled on our side and stays free and will continue this way. We do recommend you to use [the featured Search-UI](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch) or fork it on your own.
