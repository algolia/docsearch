title: Customize my DocSearch

## What content do we recommend to index?

### Code blocks

We **do not recommend** indexing **code tags** since code blocks are most likely
very similar and redundant from one page to another.
You can exclude code blocks by adding their matching selectors to `selectors_exclude`.

A good practice would be to emphasize the meaningful underlying part of it
thanks to a dedicated class, which you will want to add to the `text` selector
in your configuration file.

For example, in this code snippet, you can exclude the code but the parameters of the function:
```
<code>
function(<toIndex>something useful to search for</toIndex>)
...
</code>
```

### Table of contents

The elements of the table of contents only *target* but do not provide content.
They are merely a step on the way to reaching relevant content. As a result, they are
almost always in a different place from the payload. This is why we consider the
table of contents an obstacle for DocSearch to find the coveted information.

We therefore **do not recommend** indexing the elements of the table of contents; their matching
selectors should be added to `selectors_exclude`.

## How are my DocSearch records ranked?

DocSearch empowers the Algolia ranking strategy. The formula is completely
based on [the tie-breaking approach](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/ranking/ranking-formula/#tie-breaking-approach).

The special feature of DocSearch's ranking resides in [the custom ranking](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/ranking/custom-ranking/):

We have defined 3 main weight indicators for every record. These values are
ordered by importance following the tie-breaking approach:
1. `page_rank`: this value, equal to `0` by default, can be set from the
`start_urls` object. It can be customized in order to boost or restrain some
records depending on **their webpage's URL**. It will need to match a **specific
regular expression pattern**.

**Example:**
 ```json
{
   "index_name": "example",
    "start_urls": [
     {
      "url": "http://example.com/docs/api/v1\\.[0-9]",
      "page_rank": 1
     }
    ]
}
```
2. `level`: this value depends on the `level` of the record. A record's level is
its **deepest level attribute not null**. `text` records have a weight of 0.
3. `position`: This value is the position of the matching element within every
picked up element along the original HTML flow. The **sooner** the record appears,
the **higher** it will be ranked.

You can override the way these elements are impacting the search thanks to `custom_settings`.

 **Example:**

 ```json
"custom_settings": {
  "customRanking": [
  "asc(weight.position)",
    "desc(weight.page_rank)",
    "desc(weight.level)"
  ]
}
 ```

## Editing settings

### Why the settings made from the algolia dashboard are not persistent?

This situation only happens when you are running our DocSearch scraper on your own. 
Every time you are running the crawler, every algolia settings are overridden. If you wan to use custome algolia settings, [please use `custom_settings`](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/documentation/docsearch-scraper/config-options/#custom_settings-optional) instead.
