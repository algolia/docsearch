title: Does my project qualify?

## Our policy

We really want to improve documentation with search. Finding the information you are looking for is the very first step when reading docs. Search is key.

We are always really sorry to have to turn down request, but we are receiving so many applications everyday that we want to give some priority to public technical documentation websites.

Please note that you can [always run DocSearch on your own infra](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/documentation/docsearch-scraper/overview/) and [use our free community plan](https://www.algolia.com/pricing). We would be happy to [enhance DocSearch with your feedback](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch).

## What is required?

If you want us to host everything for you, there are some few requirements you still need to comply with:
- Be **an owner** of the snippet. You will need to inject some JS snippets.
- Your website must be **publicly available**. If your website is not, you will need to run our scrapper on a whitelisted server or implement your own authentification strategy (not supported so far).
- Your website is a **documentation**. We will reduce the scope of our scrap to helpful pages only. 
- Your website is **production ready**. We will not accept lorem ipsum website.

## What is considered as a bonus/accelerator

Since we need to prioritize requests, the following points are big advantages for your project:
- You are **Open-Source** or you provide a free plan. We care about the developer community.
- You are using a **supported documentation generator**. You can find example below.
- Your site is **server-side rendered** (ie no extra JS rendering needed)
- You are already **implementing [the generic configuration](#)**

We are always happy to help product we love. How could you know if you qualify? [Apply!](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/)

## My project is already featured

If your project is already featured or or uses a **supported** documentation-generator tool (e.g. [pkgdown](http://pkgdown.r-lib.org/index.html), [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), [gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/), [vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) .... DocSearch is totally hosted on our side and stays free and will continue this way. We do recommend you to use [the featured Search-UI](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch) or fork it on your own.
