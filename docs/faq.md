If you're not finding the answer to your question on this website, this page
will help you. If you're still unsure, don't hesitate to send [your question to
us][1] directly.

## How often will you crawl my website?

Every day.

The exact time of day might vary each day, but we'll crawl your website at most
every 24 hours.

## What do I need to install on my side?

Nothing.

The DocSearch crawler is running on our own infra. It will read the HTML content
from your website and populate an Algolia index with it every day. All you need
to do is keep your website online, and we take care of the rest. If you want to
edit your configuration, please submit a pull request.

## How much does it cost?

Nothing.

We know that paying for search infrastructure is a cost not all Open Source
projects can afford. That's why we decided to keep DocSearch free for everyone.
All we ask in exchange is that you keep the _powered by [Algolia][2]_ logo
displayed next to the search results.

If this is not possible for you, you're free to [open your own Algolia
account][3] and run DocSearch on your own without this limitation. In that case,
though, depending on the size of your documentation, you might need a paid
account (free accounts can hold as much as 10k records).

## What data are you collecting?

We save the data we extract from your website markup, which we put in a custom
JSON format instead of HTML. This is the data we put in the Algolia DocSearch
index. The selectors in your config define the data on file,

As the website owner, we also give you access to the Algolia Analytics
dashboard. This will let you have more data about the anonymized searches in
your website. You'll see the most searched terms, or those with no results.

With such Analytics, you will better understand what your users are doing.

_If you don't have Analytics access, [send us an email][1] and we'll enable it._

## Where is my data hosted?

We host the DocSearch data in Algolia's servers, with replications around the
globe. You can find more details about the actual [server specs here][4], and
more complete information in our [privacy policy][5].

## Can I use DocSearch on non-doc pages?

The free DocSearch we provide will crawl documentation pages. To use it on other
parts of your website, you'll need to create your own Algolia account and
either:

- Run the [DocSearch crawler][6] on your own
- Use one of our other [framework integrations or API clients][7]

## Can you index code samples?

Yes, but we do not recommend it.

Code samples are a great way for humans to understand how people use a specific
method. It often requires boilerplate code though, repeated across examples,
which will add noise to the results.

What we recommend instead is to exclude the code blocks from the indexing (by
using the `selectors_exclude` option in your config), and instead structure your
content so the method names are actual headers.

## Why do I have duplicate content in my results?

This can happen when you have more than one URL pointing to the same content,
for example with `./docs`, `./docs/` and `./docs/index.html`.

You set the `stop_urls` to all the patterns you want to exclude. The following
example will exclude all URLs ending with `/` or `index.html`

```json
{
  "stop_urls": ["/$", "/index.html$"]
}
```

## Why are the custom changes from the Algolia dashboard ineffective?

Changing your setting from the dashboard might be something you want to do for
some reasons .

Every successful crawl sets the DocSearch settings. These settings will be
overridden at the next crawl. We **do not recommend to edit anything from the
dashboard**. These changes come from the JSON configuration itself.

You can use the [custom_settings parameter][8] in such purpose.

## A documentation website I like does not use DocSearch. What can I do?

We'd love to help!

If one of your favorite tool documentation websites is missing DocSearch, we
encourage you to file an issue in their repository explaining how DocSearch
could help. Feel free to [send us an email][1] as well, and we'll provide all
the help we can.

## How many records does the DocSearch crawl create?

The [property `nb_hits`][8] in your configuration keeps track of the number of
records the crawl has extracted and indexed by the last DocSearch run. It
updates this number automatically.

The DocSearch scraper follows [the recommended atomic-reindexing strategy][9].
It creates a brand new temporary index to populate the data scraped from your
website. When successful, the crawl overwrite the old index defined in your
configuration with the key `index_name`.

## Why aren't my pages indexed?

We are scraping your website according to your configuration. It might happen
that some pages are missing from the search. The possible reasons for that are:

- Makes sure you are not filtering on the search by wrongly using
  `facetFilters`. [See here for more details]10].
- Make sure that an other indexed page references the page missing thanks
  to a hyperlink tag `<a/>`.
- Make sure you are [providing a compliant sitemap from the configuration]11]
  and that it references the page.

## Can I know when the next crawl will happen?

No you can't. You should be aware that we made every crawls in a day. The
position of your crawl in the queue is the lexicographic order of
your `index_name` amongs the whole list of featured website.

If none of the previous points help, you [can contact our support][1].
