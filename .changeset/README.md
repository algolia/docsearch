# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can find the full documentation for it [in the changesets repo](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

## How to contribute a changeset

Before merging your PR, you should add a changeset if your change affects any of the published packages.

1. Run `bun run changeset` in the root of the repository
2. Select the packages that are affected by your change
3. Choose the type of version bump (major, minor, or patch)
4. Write a summary of your changes that will be included in the changelog

All published `@docsearch/*` packages use a single version (fixed versioning). This means when one package is bumped, all packages get the same version.

## Releasing

When changesets are present in the `main` branch, the CI will create a "Version Packages" PR that bumps versions and updates changelogs. Merging that PR will trigger the publish workflow.
