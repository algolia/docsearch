# Create a new crawler (for DocSearch apps after July 2nd, 2024)

:::info
New DocSearch apps created after **July 2nd, 2024** can now use the Algolia Crawler UI to set up and manage their crawls. This guide walks you through the process of adding your domain, verifying ownership, creating a crawler, and running your first test crawl. You can find the new Crawler UI at [dashboard.algolia.com/crawler](https://dashboard.algolia.com/crawler).
:::

## Add domains

1. Sign in to the [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/crawler).
2. In the left sidebar, select **Data sources**.
3. Select **Crawler**:
   - Click **Add your domain** and enter the domains or subdomains you want to crawl (e.g., `example.com`, `www.example.com`).
   - If you’ve already added a domain, click the **Domains** tab.
4. Click **Add domain**.

<div className="uil-ta-center">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl('img/assets/docsearch-domains.png')}
    alt="DocSearch Domains Management"
  />
</div>

> **Note:** You must verify your domain within a 7-day grace period after adding it. Additionally, your domain must be approved for use by the DocSearch team before you can proceed with crawling.

## Verify your domain

You must verify ownership of each domain you want to crawl. The default method is email verification, but you can also use a meta tag, HTML file, robots.txt, or DNS record.

### Meta tag
1. In the **Meta tag** tab, click **Copy** to copy the verification tag.
2. Add the tag to your site's `<head>` section.
3. Publish your site and click **Verify now** in the Crawler dashboard.

### HTML file
1. In the **HTML file** tab, click **Copy** to copy the verification file content.
2. Save it as a new HTML file and upload it to your web server.
3. Add the file’s URL in the dashboard and click **Verify now**.

### robots.txt
1. In the **Robots.txt** tab, click **Copy** to copy the verification code.
2. Paste it into your site's `robots.txt` file.
3. Publish and click **Verify now**.

### DNS
1. In the **DNS** tab, copy the provided DNS TXT record.
2. Add it to your DNS provider’s settings.
3. Click **Verify now** after the record propagates (may take up to 72 hours).

## Create a new crawler

Once your domain is verified and approved by our DocSearch team:
1. Go to the **Crawler** page in the dashboard.
2. Click **New Crawler** and fill in:
   - **Crawler name** (descriptive)
   - **App ID** (your Algolia application ID)
   - **Start URL** (usually your home page)
   - **Crawler template** (choose a template or default)
3. Click **Create** to finish and run a test crawl.

## Run the test crawl

The initial crawl will visit up to 100 URLs to test access and extraction. You can monitor progress in the **Overview** page. After completion, review the extracted records in the Algolia dashboard.

## Next steps

- Edit your crawler configuration for scheduled crawls, inclusion/exclusion rules, and extraction settings.
- Use the Crawler’s suggestions for further optimization.
