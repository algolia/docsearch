title: Migrating from the legacy scraper

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Introduction

With the new version of the [DocSearch UI][1], we wanted to go further and provide better tooling for you to create and maintain your config file, and some extra Algolia features that you all have been requesting for a long time!

## What's new?

### Scraper

The DocSearch infrastructure now leverages the [Algolia Crawler][2]. We've teamed up with our friends and created a new [DocSearch helper][4], that extracts records as we were previously doing with our beloved [DocSearch scraper][3]!

The best part, is that you no longer need to install any tooling on your side if you want to maintain or update your index!

We now provide [a web interface][7] that will allow you to:

- Start, schedule and monitor your crawls
- Edit your config file from our live editor
- Test your results directly with [DocSearch v3][1]

### Algolia application and credentials

We've received a lot of requests asking for:

- A way to manage team members
- Browse and see how Algolia records are indexed
- See and subscribe to other Algolia features

They are now all available, in **your own Algolia application**, for free :D

## FAQ

You can find answers related to the DocSearch migration in our [Crawler FAQ page](/docs/crawler).
