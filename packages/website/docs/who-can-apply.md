title: Who can apply?

**Open for all developer documentation and technical blogs.**

We built DocSearch from the ground up with the idea of improving search on large technical documentations. For this reason, we are offering a free hosting version to all online technical documentations and technical blogs.

We usually turn down applications when they are not production ready or have non-technical content on the website.

## Application process

To [apply][1] to the DocSearch program, follow the DocSearch onboarding process in the Algolia dashboard where you'll submit your domain for an automated validation check against our requirements. If your domain meets all criteria, you'll be quickly approved to proceed with creating your DocSearch crawler.

- ✅ Using one of our official integrations will streamline your implementation process after data ingestion.

- ✅ You must verify your domain ownership within 7 days of approval to continue using the crawler.

- ✅ Please review [DocSearch Plan Terms and Conditions][2].

## Process duration

DocSearch application process includes automated validation for faster processing. However, if we can't automatically determine your eligibility, we'll conduct a manual review that may take 1-2 business days.

Once approved, you can continue the onboarding process to create your DocSearch crawler. After your data is ingested into Algolia, you'll need to implement the search UI using either our provided code snippet or one of our [integrations][3].

*At the moment, the automated onboarding flow is only available for new users signing up for DocSearch. If you’re an existing Algolia customer interested in joining the DocSearch program, please reach out to us on [Discord][4].*
