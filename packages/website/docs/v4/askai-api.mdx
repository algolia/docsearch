title: Ask AI API Reference
---

The Ask AI API enables developers to build custom chat interfaces powered by Algolia's AI assistant. Use these endpoints to create tailored conversational experiences that search your Algolia index and generate contextual responses using your own LLM provider.

:::info
This API documentation is primarily for developers building custom Ask AI integrations. If you're using the DocSearch package, you typically won't need this information since DocSearch handles the Ask AI API integration automatically. For standard DocSearch usage, see the [DocSearch documentation](/docs/docsearch) instead.
