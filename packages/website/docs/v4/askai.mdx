## Overview

AskAI is a conversational AI product that transforms your technical content—like support articles, developer docs, and blogs—into an intelligent, on-site chatbot experience. Built on top of Algolia Search, AskAI combines the precision of structured search with the flexibility of generative AI to deliver fast, context-aware support answers directly from your existing content.

## Why you should use AskAI

- **Empower Users with Instant Support**: Let users get accurate, conversational answers from your tech docs, blogs, and support content—without digging through pages.
- **Reduce Ticket Volume**: Deflect repetitive support queries by resolving them through automated, intelligent chat experiences.
- **Built on Algolia**: Leverage the speed and relevance of your Algolia-powered search index as a trusted foundation for AI responses.
- **Simple to Deploy**: Integrate AskAI into your site with minimal setup and no need to retrain models or manually tag data.
- **Always Up to Date**: AskAI syncs with your search content, ensuring responses evolve alongside your documentation.
- **Scalable & Customizable**: Whether for internal support or customer-facing portals, tailor the experience to your brand and scale it as your content grows.
- **Flexible LLM Choice (BYOLLM)**: Integrate with the language model that fits your needs—OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, or others.

To get started with AskAI on your site, begin by creating and configuring your Ask AI assistant—including its model, prompt, and allowed domains where Ask AI should run.

1. Go to **Data Sources > Ask AI**.
2. Click **"Create Your Assistant"** to start setting up your Ask AI service.
3. Follow the prompts to configure your setup.

### Add the domains where Ask AI should run (Required)

Define where Ask AI is allowed to run. Add all domains and subdomains where your assistants should be active. You can add exact domains or use wildcard patterns to cover multiple subdomains at once.
Only the domains or patterns you add here will be whitelisted, if a site or pattern isn't listed Ask AI won't work there. You can add multiple entries now or come back later to add more.

Examples:

* www.example.com
* help.example.com
* \*.example.com

**Note:** You can add more domains at any time after the initial setup.
Go to Data Sources \> Ask AI \> click on “Add Domain" button.

### Configure model and settings

Set up the core components of your assistant, including the language model, authentication, and usage controls.

* **Choose your LLM provider**: Select a supported provider, such as OpenAI or Anthropic. You'll need to have an account with them and access to an API key.
* **Select a model**: Pick a specific model from your chosen provider. Newer models typically offer better performance, with faster and more accurate responses.
* **Enter your API key**: Provide the API key from your provider to authenticate requests. This connects your assistant to the selected model.
* **Set usage limits**: Define a maximum token limit to control the length of responses and manage costs. Tokens represent small pieces of text (e.g., words or characters).
* **Name your configuration**: Give your assistant configuration a unique name for easy reference. We'll suggest a default name, but you can change it anytime.

### **Define Assistant Behaviour**

Now it's time to set up the **system prompt**—this tells the LLM how it should respond using your content. The system prompt shapes your assistant's tone, style, and behavior.

AskAI provides **three default prompt templates** to help you get started. You can:

* **Use a pre-built prompt**: Quickly launch with a default configuration.
* **Customize an existing prompt**: Adjust the wording to better fit your tone or use case.
* **Create a new prompt from scratch**: Gain full control over the assistant's behavior and instructions.

Choose the option that best matches your support experience. No matter which option you select, be sure to **name your prompt**—this makes it easy to manage and reuse later.

Create new prompt using a pre-built template:

  alt="How it works"
/>

Or from scratch:

  alt="How it works"
/>


**Note:** Prompts can be reused for any assistants you create in the future. Once you've created a custom prompt, you'll be able to select it again by choosing the **“Use existing prompt"** option in this view.
