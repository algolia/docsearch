title: Whitelisted domains
---

DocSearch AskAI can only run on domains or domain patterns explicitly allowed (whitelisted). Domains not listed here will not be permitted to use AskAI, ensuring security and preventing unauthorized use. You can manage this list at any time.

Use wildcards (`*`) to easily match multiple subdomains, for example:

* `*.example.com` matches `blog.example.com`, `docs.example.com`, etc.

## Adding a Domain

To allow AskAI on a new domain:

1. Navigate to **Data Sources > Ask AI** in your Algolia Dashboard.
2. Click **Add Domain**.
3. Enter your domain or wildcard pattern.
4. Save your changes.

New domains are activated immediately.

## Removing a Domain

To revoke AskAI permissions from a domain:

1. Navigate to **Data Sources > Ask AI** in your Algolia Dashboard.
2. Locate the domain you wish to remove.
3. Click the **Remove** button next to the domain.
4. Confirm your action.

The domain will be removed immediately, disabling AskAI access.
