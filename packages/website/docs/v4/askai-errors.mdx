title: Ask AI Errors Reference
---

These error codes correspond to issues encountered when using Ask AI. Each code includes a short description and possible resolutions.

## General API errors

These error codes represent issues at the HTTP or service level, independent of the AI stream. They cover authentication, routing, rate limiting, and server errors.

---

### AI-201 - Bad input {#ai-201}

The request included data that could not be used to find a resource, or the data was malformed.

> **Solution:** Make sure you are setting the correct configuration options for [DocSearch][1] or [SiteSearch][2], and that you are passing the correct [request body][3] in your API call.

### AI-202 - Unauthorized {#ai-202}

There was an issue validating the authentication token for the request.

> **Solution**: Ensure that you are including a valid authentication token in your request headers and that it has not expired.

### AI-203 - Forbidden {#ai-203}

Access to the requested resource is unavailable or forbidden for this requester.

> **Solution**: Verify that your domain is [whitelisted][4], that you are using the correct assistantId, and that your account has the necessary permissions for this resource.

### AI-204 - HTTP error {#ai-204}

There was an issue with HTTP routing or endpoint configuration. This may indicate a problem with the target URL, proxy setup, or request path.

> **Solution**: Double-check that the API endpoint is correct and that your network or proxy configuration allows outbound connections.

### AI-205 - Too many attempts {#ai-205}

Too many requests were made within the designated time window. Your requests are being rate-limited.

> **Solution**: Wait for the rate limit window to reset before sending additional requests.

### AI-206 - Unknown {#ai-206}

An unknown error occurred.

> **Solution**: Retry the request. If the issue persists, contact support with the full request and response details.

### AI-207 - Internal error {#ai-207}

An internal error occurred within the Ask AI service.

> **Solution**: Retry your request later. If the problem continues, contact support with the error ID or timestamp.

## Ask AI chat errors

These error codes represent issues with the AI stream or upstream LLM providers.

### AI-208 - Provider API call error {#ai-208}

There was an issue communicating with the upstream provider’s API. This can occur when the provider returns an unexpected response or a timeout.

> **Solution:** Check the provider's API status page(s) to see if they are experiencing any ongoing issues.

### AI-209 - Provider retry error {#ai-209}

There were too many failed attempts at communicating with the upstream provider. This could be caused by issues on the provider's end, an invalid API key, or a network issue causing repeated retries.

> **Solution:** Check the provider's API status page(s) to see if they are experiencing any ongoing issues.

### AI-210 - No tool available {#ai-210}

The AI runtime could not call the requested tool. This usually means the tool name referenced in your request does not exist or was not registered in the SDK configuration.

> **Solution:** Be sure not to ask for any specific tool calls within your custom prompt. Ask AI has specific tools it uses to give the best results.

### AI-213 - Billing error {#ai-213}

The upstream provider could not process the request due to a billing or quota issue.

> **Solution:** You will need to log in to your provider’s dashboard to remedy this issue.
