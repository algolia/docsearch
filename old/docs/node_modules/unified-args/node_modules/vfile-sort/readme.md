Sort [vfile][] messages.

*   First sorts by line/column: earlier messages come first
*   If two messages occurred at the same place, sorts fatal error before
    warnings, before info messages
*   Otherwise, uses `localeCompare` to compare `source`, `ruleId`, or finally
    `reason`

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install vfile-sort
```

## Usage

```js
var vfile = require('vfile')
var sort = require('vfile-sort')

var file = vfile()

file.message('Error!', {line: 3, column: 1})
file.message('Another!', {line: 2, column: 2})

sort(file)

console.log(file.messages.map(String))
// => ['2:2: Another!', '3:1: Error!']
```
