remark preset to configure `remark-lint` with settings that the
[Markdown Style Guide](http://www.cirosantilli.com/markdown-style-guide/)
recommends.

This uses the following Style Guide option system: `wrap:space`,
`header:atx`, `list-marker:hyphen`, `list-space:mixed`, and
`code:fenced`.

###### `space-sentence`

Both `space-sentence:1` and `space-sentence:2` are not supported
by `remark-lint`.
You could set-up
[`remark-retext`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-retext)
with
[`retext-sentence-spacing`](https://github.com/retextjs/retext-sentence-spacing)
to check this though.

###### `wrap`

`wrap:inner-sentence` and `wrap:sentence` are not supported by
`remark-lint`.

The default is `wrap:space`.
To use `wrap:no`, turn off `remark-lint-maximum-line-length` like so:

```diff
 "plugins": [
   ...
   "preset-lint-markdown-style-guide",
+  ["lint-maximum-line-length", false]
   ...
 ]
```

###### `header`

The default is `header:atx`.
To use `header:setext`, change the setting for `remark-lint-heading-style`
like so:

```diff
 "plugins": [
   ...
   "preset-lint-markdown-style-guide",
+  ["lint-heading-style", "setext"]
   ...
 ]
```

###### `list-marker`

The default is `list-marker:hyphen`.
For `list-marker:asterisk` or `list-marker:plus`, change the setting for
`remark-lint-unordered-list-marker-style` like so:

```diff
 "plugins": [
   ...
   "preset-lint-markdown-style-guide",
+  ["lint-unordered-list-marker-style", "*"]
   ...
 ]
```

###### `list-space`

The default is `list-space:mixed`.
For `list-space:1`, change the setting for `remark-lint-list-item-indent`
like so:

```diff
 "plugins": [
   ...
   "preset-lint-markdown-style-guide",
+  ["lint-list-item-indent", "space"]
   ...
 ]
```

###### `code`

The default is `code:fenced`.
For `code:indented`, change the setting for `remark-lint-code-block-style`
like so:

```diff
 "plugins": [
   ...
   "preset-lint-markdown-style-guide",
+  ["lint-code-block-style", "indented"]
   ...
 ]
```
