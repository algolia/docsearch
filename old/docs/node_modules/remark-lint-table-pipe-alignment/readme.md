# remark-lint-table-pipe-alignment

Warn when table pipes are not aligned.

## Fix

[`remark-stringify`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/master/packages/remark-stringify)
tries to align tables by default. Pass
[`paddedTable: false`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/master/packages/remark-stringify#optionspaddedtable)
to not align cells.

Aligning cells perfectly is impossible as some characters (such as emoji or
Chinese characters) are rendered differently in different browsers, terminals,
and editors. You can pass your own
[`stringLength`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/master/packages/remark-stringify#optionsstringlength)
function to customize how cells are aligned. In which case this rule must
be turned off.

See [Using remark to fix your markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint#using-remark-to-fix-your-markdown)
on how to automatically fix warnings for this rule.

## Install

```

## Usage

You probably want to use it on the CLI through a config file:

```diff
 ...
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     ...
     "lint",
+    "lint-table-pipe-alignment",
     ...
   ]
 }
 ...
```

Or use it on the CLI directly

```sh
remark -u lint -u lint-table-pipe-alignment readme.md
```

Or use this on the API:

```diff
 var remark = require('remark');
 var report = require('vfile-reporter');

 remark()
   .use(require('remark-lint'))
+  .use(require('remark-lint-table-pipe-alignment'))
   .process('_Emphasis_ and **importance**', function (err, file) {
     console.error(report(err || file));
   });
```
