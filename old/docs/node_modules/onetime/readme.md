# onetime [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/onetime.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/onetime)

> Ensure a function is only called once

When called multiple times it will return the return value from the first call.

*Unlike the module [once](https://github.com/isaacs/once), this one isn't naughty and extending `Function.prototype`.*


## Install

```
$ npm install onetime
```


## Usage

```js
const onetime = require('onetime');

let i = 0;

const foo = onetime(() => ++i);

foo(); //=> 0
foo(); //=> 0
foo(); //=> 0

onetime.callCount(foo); //=> 3
```

```js
const onetime = require('onetime');

const foo = onetime(() => {}, {throw: true});

foo();

foo();
//=> Error: Function `foo` can only be called once
```


## API
