DocSearch default colorscheme comes in a grey theme with blue highlight.

## Colorscheme

![Default colorscheme][1]

This theme works well with most websites, but we encourage you to style it to
your own theme. You can achieved it by overriding the CSS classes used by the
default theme.

The following annotated example will help you style each part:

```css
/* Main dropdown wrapper */
.algolia-autocomplete .ds-dropdown-menu {
  width: 500px;
}

/* Main category (eg. Getting Started) */
.algolia-autocomplete .algolia-docsearch-suggestion--category-header {
  color: darkgray;
  border: 1px solid gray;
}

/* Category (eg. Downloads) */
.algolia-autocomplete .algolia-docsearch-suggestion--subcategory-column {
  color: gray;
}

/* Title (eg. Bootstrap CDN) */
.algolia-autocomplete .algolia-docsearch-suggestion--title {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: black;
}

/* Description description (eg. Bootstrap currently works...) */
.algolia-autocomplete .algolia-docsearch-suggestion--text {
  font-size: 0.8rem;
  color: gray;
}

/* Highlighted text */
.algolia-autocomplete .algolia-docsearch-suggestion--highlight {
  color: blue;
}
```

## Attribution

We're happy to provide DocSearch free of charge for any documentation website,
and you're encouraged to style it to fit your own theming. All we ask is that
you keep the `search by Algolia` logo and link next to your search results.

The logo is automatically added in the dropdown with the default styling. It's
our way to let more people know about what we do, and how they could benefit
from a fast and relevant search on their website.

If you're using your own [paid Algolia account][2] and [run the crawler
yourself][3], you don't have to keep the logo.

## Debugging

To inspect the dropdown markup with your browser tools, you should add
`debug: true` to your `docsearch` call to prevent it from closing on inspection.

```javascript
docsearch({
  [â€¦],
  debug: true
});
```

## Other considerations

It wraps selected suggestions in a `.ds-cursor` class. This means that you can
use `.ds-cursor .algolia-docsearch-suggestion--content` to style the selected
suggestion for example.

On small screens, DocSearch reverts to a single column layout, while is uses the
two-column layout shown in the screenshot on larger screens. You can add media
queries (for example `@media (min-width: 768px) {}`) to target different
displays.

## Advanced styling

Whether you would like to do more heavy styling, feel free to have a look at the
[SCSS source code][4]. `_variables.scss` contains all the default theming,
sizing and breakpoints.

You can generate your own CSS file by cloning the repository and running
`yarn run build:css`. It generates the resulting file in `./dist/cdn`, and you
should use them instead of the default one.
